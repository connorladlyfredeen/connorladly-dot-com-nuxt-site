      I've been working in tech for over 10 years, and I've had the opportunity
      to work with some amazing people and companies. I've worked on everything
      from small startups to large enterprises, and I've learned a lot along the
      way.

      Pardon the lack of styling, this site is perpetually in progress and a
      chance to play around with new techbnologies. As of Jan 2025 it is a
      Nuxt.j site hosted on Netlify, with content stored in a GitHub repo and
      proxied through a GCP Instance.
